Add Logs
=============================================

Logging is a crucial aspect of any software system, as it allows developers to keep track of what's happening in their code and quickly diagnose and fix issues when they arise. The `logging` module in Python provides a powerful and flexible way to manage logging in your application.

Step 1: Import the logging module

Start by importing the `logging` module in your Python file:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

Step 2: Get a logger instance

To use the `logging` module, you first need to get an instance of the logger. You can create a logger with a specific name by calling the `getLogger()` method on the `logging` module:

.. code-block:: python

    db_logger = logging.getLogger('db')

Here, we're creating a logger with the name 'db', which we'll use to log messages related to our database operations.

Step 3: Log messages

Once you have a logger instance, you can use it to log messages at different levels of severity, including `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical`. Here's an example of logging an `info` message:

.. code-block:: python

    db_logger.info('info message')

You can also log `warning` messages:

.. code-block:: python

    db_logger.warning('warning message')

Step 4: Log exceptions

In addition to logging messages, you can also log exceptions using the `exception()` method of the logger. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        1/0
    except Exception as e:
        db_logger.exception(e)

This code will log the exception message and stack trace at the `ERROR` level.

Step 5: Configure logging settings

By default, the `logging` module will write log messages to the console. However, you can customize the logging settings by configuring a logging handler. For example, you can write log messages to a file or send them to a remote server. You can also customize the log format and level.
